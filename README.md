  <summary>👨‍💻 More about me</summary>

  - 💬 I am 24 years old, currently living in Brazil. I am trying to achieve fluency in English and have some experience with SQL, Python, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. I enjoy participating in **hackathons**, where I collaborate with others to solve complex challenges under tight deadlines. These experiences have helped me develop key skills such as **problem-solving**, **teamwork**, **adaptability**, **creativity**, and **critical thinking**. Working in these high-pressure environments has been both rewarding and inspiring, pushing me to constantly improve and innovate.

  - ⚡ In my free time, I love immersing myself in stories—whether through a good book, manga, or comics—as well as watching movies and playing games. I firmly believe that our personal passions enrich our perspective on the world and enhance our ability to solve problems creatively.
